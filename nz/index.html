        <h1>Sandfly Bay Teaser</h1>
        <p>Sandfly Bay is a sandy bay with large dunes 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) east of central Dunedin, New Zealand.
            Located on the southern side of Otago Peninsula, between Seal Point and the Gull Rocks on the western
            side of Sandymount,[1] Sandfly Bay is a Department of Conservation wildlife reserve frequented by trampers.

            Sandfly Bay is approximately 1.5 kilometres (0.93 mi) across when measured in a straight line between the
            headlands.
            On the western side the cliffs of Seal Point rise directly out of the sea in a near-straight wall about
            900 metres (3,000 ft) long; beyond Seal Point along the coast lies Boulder Beach. On the eastern side
            lies a 1.1 kilometres (0.68 mi) white sand beach, facing south-southwest, crossed by the mouth of Morris
            Creek flowing in from the north. Towards the eastern end of the bay the dunes rise to over 100 metres (330
            ft)
            above the shoreline, forming the lower slopes of Sandymount. The beach ends in a rocky headland, with an
            assortment of small islands known as the Gull Rocks standing out of the sea off its southern point.[1]
            The largest of these is known as Lion Rock or Lion's Head Rock, due to its shape. A distinctive landmark,
            it can be clearly seen in good weather from Second Beach, close to Saint Clair, 18 kilometres (11 mi) to the
            west.
            East of this headland the Otago Peninsula coastline turns northeastward at Harakeke Point.[1]
            The bay is accessible from Seal Point Road or a walking track from Sandymount.
